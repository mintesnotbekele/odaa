    content: "
      <p>We were excited to work with Saptarshee Mandal, whose startup has been making waves across the globe in the medical equipment industry. Saptarshee Mandal's company sells medical equipment for ophthalmologists and has multiple branches worldwide, with their CEO traveling around the world to promote their products.

Odaa Garaadoo, we were tasked with developing an e-commerce website and a mobile app that would allow ophthalmologists and hospitals to purchase medical equipment directly from Saptarshee Mandal's company. We utilized Laravel, PHP, and Flutter to build a website and mobile app that's intuitive, user-friendly, and secure, ensuring that their customers can have a seamless purchasing experience.</p>
